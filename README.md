# Sales_analysis
In this project, I first performed data transformation and cleaning to prepare the dataset for analysis and visualization. This included clearing unnecessary columns, handling NULL values, adding new columns, joining tables, and managing primary keys (PK) and foreign keys (FK) between tables.

Next, I utilized Excel, Power Query, and Power Pivot to conduct an in-depth sales analysis. The goal was to analyze the data, identify key performance metrics, and deliver actionable insights.

Finally, I leveraged various charts and visualizations to create an informative, user-friendly, and visually appealing interactive dashboard.
